# What is Envoy ? 

We help you (content apps) use your content to attract qualified leads. We do this by placing content previews inside a high-converting web flow we host on your behalf.

</figure>

There are two key ways for you to use the Envoy flow:
1. Through **gifting**: Allow your users to share. This requires a lightweight integration.
2. Through **marketing links**: generate links 


| Feature     | Short description |      Integration needed?        | Illustrated example |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------  |
| Gifting      |   Enable your users to share with their friends.   |   Yes    | <img src="../images/player_views.png" style="width: 300px;"/>       |
| Marketing links   | Generate links in a no-code way               |    No    | <img src="../images/player_views.png" style="width: 300px;"/>       |
| Rewards   | Boost sharing by creating incentives for your users   |    Yes   | <img src="../images/player_views.png" style="width: 300px;"/>       |
